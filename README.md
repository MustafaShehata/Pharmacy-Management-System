# Pharmacy Management System

Pharmacy Management System is a web application using React in frontend and Nodejs in backend.

## Introduction

The purpose of this web app is to improve my skills in React and Nodejs.

Also I need to make a practical work to apply some feature such as paying, chat with pharmacist, and admin dashboard with charts.

## Features

- [ ] Authentication
