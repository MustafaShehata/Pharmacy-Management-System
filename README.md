# Pharmacy Management System

Pharmacy Management System is a web application using React in frontend and nodejs in backend.

## Introduction

The purpose of this web app is to improve my skills in React and Nodejs.

Also I need to make a practical work to apply some feature such as paying, chat with pharmacist, and admin dashboard with charts.

## Features

- [ ] Authentication (Sign Up/Sign In)
- [ ] Inventory Management
- [ ] Orders
- [ ] Prescription Upload & Approval
- [ ] User roles and permission (Admin, Pharmacist, Customer)

## Future Features

- [ ] Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Payment
- [ ] Approve & Manage
- [ ] Search Medicine
- [ ] Email Notification
